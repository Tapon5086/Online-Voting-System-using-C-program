# 🗳️ Online Voting System (C Program)

The **Online Voting System** is a console-based application developed in **C language**. It simulates a simple and secure voting process where users can vote, view vote counts, and manage candidate records. Designed to demonstrate core programming logic, this project is ideal for learning about file handling, conditional logic, and user interaction in C.
